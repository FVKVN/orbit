# Contributing

We follow most of the procedures for contributions from the [Symfony](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) and [Sylius](http://sylius.org) project, as such much of this info will look familiar as it embodies current best practices.

* [Reporting a bug or a security issue](./reporting-issues.md)
* [Submitting pull requests](./pull-requests.md)
* [Roadmap](./roadmap.md)
